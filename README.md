## New_Functionality


## Slack_Handle

My _**slack handle**_ for the [ALC with Google 3.0](alcwithgoogle3.slack.com) is [@aus7yne](https://alcwithgoogle3.slack.com/team/UAKLQ7VJ4). 

## Experience

I gained a lot of experience during the training on Udacity and more during the project. Not only did I learn how to work with service worker, cache and indexeddb but I now have a strong feeling that I can build an progressive web applications. 

## Appreciation

All thanks to [Google](www.google.com), [ALC](https://andela.com), and [Udacity](www.udacity.com) for giving me such a wonderful opportunity to become a _**Mobile Web Specialist**_.
Thank you:)
