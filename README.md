The application must make use of the following

2. Cache API
3. IndexedDB

**Application Functions**
This application is able to:
1. Select currencies to be converted from and to
2. Convert currencies while the application is online or offline

## Experience

I gained a lot of experience during the training on Udacity and more during the project. Not only did I learn how to work with service worker, cache and indexeddb but I now have a strong feeling that I can build an progressive web applications. 

## Appreciation

All thanks to [Google](www.google.com), [ALC](https://andela.com), and [Udacity](www.udacity.com) for giving me such a wonderful opportunity to become a _**Mobile Web Specialist**_.
